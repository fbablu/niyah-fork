# Niyah - Project Guide

> Focus app with financial stakes. Users deposit money, stake it on focus sessions, and earn more for completing them. Quit early = lose your stake.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React Native 0.81 + Expo SDK 54 (New Architecture)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (file-based routing, typed routes)
- **State**: Zustand (one store per domain)
- **Styling**: StyleSheet, SF Pro Rounded, dark/light theme
- **Build**: EAS Build (production), `expo-dev-client` (dev) -- NOT Expo Go
- **Backend**: Firebase Auth + Firestore via `@react-native-firebase/*`
- **Auth**: Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In, Email magic link, Phone SMS OTP
- **Payments**: Stripe (`@stripe/stripe-react-native`, Cloud Functions backend)
- **Testing**: Jest + jest-expo (1018 tests)
- **Linting**: ESLint 9 + Prettier
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Quick Reference

```bash
pnpm install           # Install deps
pnpm start             # Dev server (build dev client first)
pnpm build:local       # iOS build to USB device
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm ci                # lint + typecheck + test
pnpm typecheck         # TypeScript check
```

## Key Conventions

### TypeScript

- Strict mode. Types in `src/types/index.ts`
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes

### Components

- Functional only, hooks for state/effects
- Keep under 150 lines. Props interface above component.

### Styling

- `StyleSheet.create()` at bottom of file
- `useColors()` for theme colors. 8px spacing grid (`Spacing.*`).
- `Font.regular/medium/semibold/bold/heavy` for font weights

### State (Zustand)

- One store per domain, keep flat
- Stores call each other via `getState()`. Lazy `require()` for circular deps.
- Firestore writes are fire-and-forget (local state = source of truth)

### Navigation

- File-based routing in `app/`. Groups for layouts.
- `router.push()` to navigate, `router.replace()` for auth redirects
- Typed routes: `experiments.typedRoutes: true`

### Native Modules

- Custom modules in `modules/`, Swift via ExpoModulesCore
- Config in `expo-module.config.json`, referenced via `nativeModulesDir: "modules"` in `app.config.ts`

## Config & Secrets

| What                  | Where                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Client env vars       | `.env` (see `.env.example`)             |
| Stripe secret/webhook | Firebase Secret Manager                 |
| Firebase config files | `firebase/` (gitignored, local only)    |
| EAS cloud builds      | Upload config files as EAS file secrets |

`app.config.ts` reads env vars at build time. No secrets hardcoded in source. See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

## Current Phase

**Launch — App Store submission, targeting live by ~NYC arrival (early June 2026).** Real Stripe/Plaid money paths. The April 15 demo and the April–May campus finals launch already shipped. **Live status + the full phased next-steps plan are in [docs/may-23-resume.md](docs/may-23-resume.md) — read that first in a new session.**

Shipped to `launch` (pushed, NOT yet deployed as of 2026-05-25):

- In-app account deletion (`deleteAccount` CF + Profile UI) — App Store 5.1.1(v)
- In-app Stripe bank management + `niyah.live/stripe/return` bounce → `niyah://stripe-return`
- `requestWithdrawal` balance-integrity fix; `mergeOne` pagination; withdrawal eligibility gate removed
- Plaid per-Item webhook URL; de-gamble copy ("Won"→"Earned", invite reframed)

Key remaining (see may-23-resume.md for the phased plan):

- **Deploy:** `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,functions` + publish landing bounce (merge `launch`→`main`)
- Live Stripe/Plaid keys; Apple APNs + `pnpm build:production`; App Store Connect listing (privacy labels, account-deletion disclosure) → submit
- Keep `APP_CHECK_ENFORCED=false` until App Check Metrics ≥99% verified
- FamilyControls Distribution already approved for all 5 extensions

Roadmap: [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)

## Demo Mode

`DEMO_MODE` is env-var driven (`EXPO_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`). Real Firebase auth, short session timers, $50 starting balance, Cloud Function calls skipped. See [docs/features.md](docs/features.md#demo-mode).

## Legal

Niyah is a **commitment contract** app, NOT gambling. Same model as stickK and Beeminder.

- Avoid: "bet," "wager," "gamble," "win"
- Use: "stake," "commitment," "goal," "complete"
- App Store category: Productivity
