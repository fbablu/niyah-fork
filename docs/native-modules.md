## Firebase (RNFB)

React Native Firebase packages provide Auth and Firestore:

| Package                            | Purpose                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@react-native-firebase/app`       | Core initialization (Expo plugin in `app.config.js`)   |
| `@react-native-firebase/auth`      | Google, Apple, email magic link, and phone SMS sign-in |
| `@react-native-firebase/firestore` | User profiles, wallets, sessions, follows              |
| `@react-native-firebase/messaging` | FCM push notifications (token management, foreground)  |

**Config file**: `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) lives in `firebase/` (gitignored). Injected at build time by the `withGoogleServicesPlist` config plugin. `withFirebaseStaticFrameworks` handles CocoaPods static framework linking.

**JS wrapper**: `src/config/firebase.ts` -- all auth, Firestore CRUD, and social helpers.

## Screen Time Module (`modules/niyah-screentime/`)

Custom Expo module bridging iOS Screen Time API to JavaScript.

### Swift Components

The first two files live in `modules/niyah-screentime/ios/`; the three extension files
(`DeviceActivityMonitorExtension`, `ShieldActionExtension`, `ShieldConfigurationExtension`) now live
under `targets/` and are registered by `@bacons/apple-targets` (see [iOS Extension Targets](#ios-extension-targets)).

| File                                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NiyahScreenTimeModule.swift`          | FamilyControls auth, FamilyActivityPicker, ManagedSettings shield (block/unblock). App selection persisted via App Groups `UserDefaults` with `PropertyListEncoder`. Polls for violations and emits `onShieldViolation` events to JS. |
| `AppPickerHostingController.swift`     | SwiftUI wrapper for `FamilyActivityPicker`, presented modally as `UIHostingController`. Supports Done and Cancel callbacks.                                                                                                           |
| `DeviceActivityMonitorExtension.swift` | App Extension (separate process). Detects blocked app opens during sessions, records violation timestamps to shared `UserDefaults`. Uses named `ManagedSettingsStore(.niyahSession)`.                                                 |
| `ShieldActionExtension.swift`          | Handles user actions on the shield overlay (e.g., "Surrender Session" button tap). Communicates back to main app.                                                                                                                     |
| `ShieldConfigurationExtension.swift`   | Configures custom shield appearance — Niyah-branded overlay with "Stay Focused" / "Surrender Session" buttons instead of generic system block.                                                                                        |

### JS Wrapper

`src/config/screentime.ts` -- typed convenience functions for:

- Authorization (`requestAuthorization`)
- App picker (`presentAppPicker`)
- Blocking (`startBlocking` / `stopBlocking`)
- Violation events (`onShieldViolation` subscription)

### Extension Registration

The Screen Time / Live Activity app extensions are **no longer injected by config plugins**. As of
Lane B (2026-05-16) they live in top-level `targets/` (`monitor`, `report`, `shieldaction`,
`shieldconfig`, `widget`) and are registered by `@bacons/apple-targets` via each target's
`expo-target.config.json` (FamilyControls + App Group `group.com.niyah.app` entitlements declared
there). The old `withScreenTimeEntitlement.js` / `withDeviceActivityMonitor.js` plugins were removed.
See [iOS Extension Targets](#ios-extension-targets) below.

### Requirements

- iOS 16+, physical device only (no Simulator)
- FamilyControls entitlement enabled on App ID (Apple Developer portal)

### Status

Swift code is production-quality. JS wrapper complete. Custom shield UI built and branded. Quick-block flow (`quick-block.tsx`) and group session flow (`active.tsx`) are wired to `startBlocking()`/`stopBlocking()`. Shield surrender desync fixed: shield sets `niyah_surrender_requested` flag + opens app via deep link, JS listener catches it and calls `stopBlocking()`. Scheduled blocking APIs (`startScheduledBlocking`/`stopScheduledBlocking`) exported but deferred post-demo.

Extension targets are embedded by `@bacons/apple-targets` from `targets/` (see [iOS Extension Targets](#ios-extension-targets)); the old `withDeviceActivityMonitor.js` embed-phase workaround was retired with the migration. See [Roadmap](./roadmap.md).

### Custom Shield UX

The custom Niyah-branded shield is implemented via `ShieldConfigurationExtension.swift` and `ShieldActionExtension.swift`:

- User starts a focus session (or quick block) and selects distraction apps
- Opening a restricted app shows a **custom shield screen** with Niyah branding
- Two options: **"Surrender Session"** (lose stake, end session) or **"Stay Focused"** (dismiss, return)
- Button actions handled by `ShieldActionExtension`, which communicates back to the main app

iOS does not allow injecting modals into other apps. The custom shield via `ManagedSettingsStore` is the only API-compliant approach.

## iOS Extension Targets

> ⚠️ **Lane B (2026-05-16) moved all extensions to `@bacons/apple-targets` under top-level `targets/`**
> (`monitor`, `report`, `shieldaction`, `shieldconfig`, `widget`), registered via
> `targets/*/expo-target.config.json` — **not** via config plugins. The `DeviceActivityReport` and
> Live Activity extensions below are **shipped**, not planned; paths in older sections of this file
> that point at `modules/niyah-screentime/ios/` or `ios/Niyah*/` are stale. See [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md).

### `NiyahDeviceActivityReport`

iOS 16+ app extension built on the `DeviceActivityReport` API — the only sanctioned way to read per-app usage data on a non-MDM device. Surfaces aggregated daily/weekly usage for the user's selected `FamilyActivitySelection` categories.

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `targets/report/DeviceActivityReport.swift` | Extension entry point with SwiftUI scenes for daily/weekly views. |
| `targets/report/expo-target.config.json` | `type: device-activity-report`, bundle id suffix `.device-activity-report`, FamilyControls Distribution entitlement + App Group declared here. |
| App Group `UserDefaults` (`group.com.niyah.app`) | Extension writes baseline snapshots (top apps + daily-average minutes per category). Main app reads via `getScreenTimeBaseline()`. |

Bridge method on `NiyahScreenTimeModule.swift`:

```swift
func getScreenTimeBaseline() -> [(appToken, dailyAverageMinutes, weeklyTotal, category)]
```

JS wrapper in `src/config/screentime.ts`. Powers:

- Redesigned app-selection onboarding (Lane B3 — "Select all apps to monitor" + per-app prioritization with usage badges).
- Group equity cap-target model (see [Group Equity](./group-equity.md)) — provides the trusted `baselineMs` input to `calculatePayouts`.

Registration: declared as the `report` target (`targets/report/expo-target.config.json`) and picked up by `@bacons/apple-targets` alongside `monitor`, `shieldaction`, `shieldconfig`, and `widget`.

### `NiyahLiveActivity`

ActivityKit + WidgetKit widget extension for **lock-screen + Dynamic Island** in-session UX.

| Layout | Content |
| ------ | ------- |
| Lock screen | Niyah blob, big timer, top-3 leaderboard with status dots + violation counts. |
| Dynamic Island (compact) | Timer + blob mark. |
| Dynamic Island (expanded) | Timer + 3-row leaderboard. |
| Minimal | Timer only. |

`ActivityAttributes` carries `sessionId`, `sessionType` (solo/group), `endsAt`, `blobAssetName`, and a compact leaderboard array (name + status + violations).

Bridge methods (on `NiyahScreenTimeModule.swift`, exposed as `AsyncFunction`s):

```swift
func startLiveActivity(attrs)
func updateLiveActivity(state)
func endLiveActivity()
```

Wired into `src/store/sessionStore.ts` (solo) and `src/store/groupSessionStore.ts` (group):

- Session start → `startLiveActivity`.
- Each Firestore session-doc tick (`subscribeToSession`) → `updateLiveActivity`.
- Complete / surrender → `endLiveActivity`.

App Group `UserDefaults` is reused for cross-process leaderboard state so the widget timeline provider can render without an active JS bridge.
