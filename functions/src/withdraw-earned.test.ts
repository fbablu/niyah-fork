/*
Real Stripe-test-mode end-to-end (manual until functions test runner is wired up):

  Setup
    - Use Stripe test mode keys; point firebase emulators at the test project.
    - Create test user A, complete Stripe Connect onboarding to "active".

  Steps
    1. Seed wallets/{A}.balance = 0.
    2. Solo session $20 stake → expect balance after stake = -$20. (Or
       deposit $20 first so the start can proceed.)
    3. Call handleSessionComplete for that session.
       Expected: wallets/{A}.balance increments to $40 (using 2x multiplier)
       or to $20 (stickK). Transaction `payout` exists with consistent
       createdAt > session.completedAt.
    4. Call requestWithdrawal($40, "standard").
       Expected: Stripe test transfer succeeds; wallets/{A}.balance = 0;
       transactions log contains `payout` then `withdrawal` in order with
       monotonically increasing createdAt; the withdrawal txn has
       stripeTransferId populated.
    5. Repeat step 4 immediately with the same body.
       Expected: Stripe returns the same transfer (idempotency key match);
       wallet stays at 0 (no double-debit).
    6. Run reconcileWalletBalances manually.
       Expected: walletAudits/{A}_{date} not written (no drift).
